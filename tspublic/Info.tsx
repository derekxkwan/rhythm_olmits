        <h1>Basic Information</h1>
        <span>The tutoring system teaches you how to <b>read and understand rhythm</b>. It tests your understanding of rhythm through <b>recording your performances of rhythm (through tapping, clapping, etc.) via microphone</b> (or <b>optionally keyboard input</b> although microphone input is preferred). If you are using the microphone input, it is recommended to <b>use headphones</b>. Rhythms are shown usually through <b>music notation</b> but are also shown in <b>shorthand</b> in various places using <b>-</b> for rests and <b>x</b> for notes.</span>
        <h1>Exercise Selection</h1>
        <span>You can access rhythms to practice using the <b>Selection screen</b>. You can choose what note durations in rhythms you want to focus on using the <b>Select Focus</b> dropdown. You can also select what note durations you want to include in your exercises using the <b>toggle boxes</b> next to each note duration. You can also select the number of exercises you want to tackle at each time using the <b>Number of Exercises</b> slider (and click <b>Get Exercises</b> to actually get them). The exercises are separated by <b>meter</b> and the progress bars tell you <b>how much progress</b> you've made overall and with respect to each duration. Some options <b>might not be available</b> to you (in both the dropdown and the toggle boxes) because you have not made enough progress in the immediately preceding note duration skill (with quarter notes being the "easiest" and always available and the note durations getting more difficult as you glance down the column). The <b>skill threshold</b> to open up new options is <span>{Misc.skill_thresh}%</span> and the <b>number of instances to master</b> a rhythm pattern is <span>{Misc.num_to_master}</span>. Progress percentages for skills below a threshold are highlighted in <span className="belowthresh">red</span>, percentages below the maxmimum but above the threshold are highlighted in <span className="abovethresh">yellow/orange</span>, and percentages that are at a maxmium are highlithed in <span className="atmax">green</span>.</span>

        <h1>Features</h1>
        <span>Here is where you can <b>read</b> and <b>perform</b> rhythm exercises. This tutoring system detects how you play rhythms through detecting attacks (taps, claps, clicks, etc.) from the <b>microphone</b> input (or through keyboard input if so desired). The <b>Detected Input</b> field shows how your attack is and flashes green when it detects attacks. How sensitive the system is to your taps can be adjusted by the <b>Input Sensitivity</b> slider so if the number is changing too often (even when you don't tap), adjust the value higher. The <b>bpm</b> slider affects how fast playback or recording goes so if things are too fast, adjust the slider to a lower value. Toggling the <b>Use Shift Keys Instead of Microphone</b> checkbox enables keyboard input and gates the attack information (the microphone input is still being detected, just not used). If you are using the microphone input, it is recommended to <b>use headphones</b> (or else the microphone will pick up what is being played by the speakers). To get an understanding of what the rhythm sounds like, check the <b>Play Back Rhythm</b> toggle. You will notice that there are beeps before the playback actually starts. This happens with recording too and this <b>count-in</b> (specified in number of beats) lets you know how fast the rhythm is going before actually listening to it or playing it. The <b>beeps</b> are the <b>metronome</b> (with high beeps on beginnings of measures, low beeps on other beats, and an additional chime when the rhythm example starts) helps you keep track of the beat and can be disabled for more of a challenge. The <b>Current Count</b> gives you the beat visually for extra help.</span>

        <h1>Rhythm Grading</h1>
        <span>The tutoring system allows for you to record your rhythm performances using the <b>Record Performance</b> toggle. The tutoring system keeps tracks of which beats you play correctly and which you do not play correctly and notifies you of the mistakes in <b>Current Beat Mistakes</b> and <b>Number of Beats Wrong</b>, giving you the exact beats where mistakes occur and the rhythmic patterns in those beats. These won't affect your overall skill progress until you progress to the next example (or go back to the selction screen if no more examples left) by clicking the <b>Accept Performance and Progress</b> button (note that until you record a performance, all beats count as a mistake). The number of tries you have left is given by the <b>Number of Tries Left</b> field (note that toggling the Record Performance box uses up a try even if you don't finish a performance. <b>Exercises Left</b> gives the number of exercises left (not counting the current exercise).</span>

        <span>Here is where you can find the progress you've made with the tutor overall or in specific meters.

The categories such as <span className="o0">"Downbeat"</span>, <span className="o1">"Second Subdivision</span>, <span className="o2">"Third Subdivision"</span>, and <span className="o3">"Fourth Subdivision"</span> refer to where actual notes (not rests) of rhythms begin with respect to the beat (and are color-coded with their individual rhythms for clarity). <b>Downbeat</b> refers to rhythms that begin on the beat, <b>Second Subdivision</b> refers to patterns that begin on the second subdivision of the beat (see Note Durations), and so on. The tutor also provides an overall view of progress with respect to meters and collates the information from each meter into an <b>overall</b> view of progress over both meters.</span>
